Main analysis : Emotion_action_analysis
Main jupyter file which contains all the code which our result is based on, the data we work with is discussed below.
Data:
1.	Park_tweet_csv_file : 10000 tweets with emotions (original dataset)
2.	Sample datasets : 4 sample datasets with random tweets from “Park_tweet_csv_file” which were annotated by research assistants.

Emotions_action_analysis_test
Testing various methods and finding various correlation without messing with the original dataset.
Threats to validity

Emotions_action_analysis_bhadreshi
A complete copy of the main analysis but we used a different pipeline to find emotions so we can deal with that discrepancy.
Data:
•	Data normalized : Normalized data from the sample datasets discussed earlier.

motivation_example_emotion_analysis
Randomly sampled a set of 300 tweets which were annotated by 1 annotator. Was intended to use as an example of the result working but we observed that majority of the fearful tweets were news related which lead it to being a threat to validity.

News_emotion_analysis
Found out that in a random set of news related tweets, the distribution of emotions is nothing out of the ordinary and was part of the motivation_example_emotion_analysis file.

Illustrative example
Tried implementing the methodology on a dataset containing an overwhelming amount of tweets of one emotion as a case of threat to validity.
Data:
•	3 files containing tweets from 3 clusters which were overwhelmingly joyful.
•	Data normalized which contains all the normalized data and merges all the files.
